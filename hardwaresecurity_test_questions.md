## Q1/ Voltage Dividers
Applying the simple voltage divider formula 
`Vout​ = Vin ​× R2/(R1+R2​​)`.

Putting given values in formula,
```
R2 / (R1+R2) = Vout/Vin
R2 / (R1+R2) = 3.3V/5V
R2 / (R1+R2) = 0.6667 V
```

To find the correct option, we find out the R2 / R1 value for each option,
```
Opt 1: R2 / (R1+R2) = 0.33 V
Opt 2: R2 / (R1+R2) = 0.72 V
Opt 3: R2 / (R1+R2) = 0.66 V
Opt 4: R2 / (R1+R2) = 0.27 V
```

Thus answer is option 3. Note that the tap out is where the voltage divider calculates the Vout from, so that is why option 1 is wrong while option 3 is correct.
